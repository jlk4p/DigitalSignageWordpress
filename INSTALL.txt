To get the theme to work you must perform these additional steps.

After installation of the More Fields plugin you need to configure this
set of fields for use as the digital signage theme expects them:
1. Define a Digital Signage (or your preferred name) box in More Fields settings.
2. Edit this box to add these Fields:
   a) Field title: Background
      Custom field key: background
      Field type: select
      Values: brown, darkblue, green, lightblue, orange, purple, red
   b) Field title: Subhead
   	  Custom field key: subhead
   	  Field type: text
   c) Field title: Web Address (please include http://)
      Custom field key: webaddress
      Caption: "Optional. Enter a URL where someone can find more information on this 
      topic. A QR code will be generated and displayed on the screen."
      Field type: text
   d) Field title: Image
      Custom field key: image
      Caption: "Optional. Use this if you don't like the text alignment of an image 
      inserted in the post. Use http:// at the beginning for images accessed on other 
      servers."
   e) Field title: Image Alignment
   	  Custom field key: imagealign
   	  Field type: select
   	  Values: *left, right
   	  NOTE: * indicates default value when field is displayed if you prefer right then
   	  values should be 'left, *right' (without quotes).
   	  
After installation of the QR Code Tag plugin, you must make sure that the data directory
in that plugin is world writeable. From a *nix command line try:
     chmod 777 /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/qr-code-tag/data
