Digital signage with Wordpress. It's pretty plugin dependent, but very
customizable. Minimum plugin requirements are:
 * More Fields (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/)
 * Post Expirator (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-expirator/)
 * QR Code Tag (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qr-code-tag/
 * WordPress Mobile Edition (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-edition/)

The entire screen is filled with carousel that, using @malsup's jQuery
Cycle Plugin, displays a single post for 18 seconds at a time. There's
also a dock at the bottom of the page with four dynamic sidebars that
are driven by jCarouselLite.

See the INSTALL.txt file for additional required steps to make the theme fully functional.
